# Tech Paper Reader - MVP PRD

## Overview
Tech Paper Reader is an iOS application that helps users stay updated with the latest scientific publications in their areas of interest. The app provides personalized paper recommendations, notifications for new relevant papers, and AI-generated summaries to help users quickly assess if a paper is worth their time.

## Target Users
- Tech professionals who want to stay updated with research in their field
- Students and researchers looking to track specific topics
- Tech enthusiasts interested in cutting-edge developments

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Topic Selection
- Users can select from predefined tech topics (e.g., AI, Blockchain, Quantum Computing)
- Each topic will be associated with relevant arXiv categories
- Users can select up to 5 topics of interest
- Topics will be stored locally on the device

### 2. Paper Discovery & Notifications
- Integration with arXiv API to fetch new papers
- Daily background fetch of new papers in selected topics
- Push notifications when new relevant papers are published
- Each notification includes:
  - Paper title
  - Authors
  - Publication date
  - Direct link to the paper
  - Quick action to generate summary

### 3. AI Paper Summarization
- Integration with Grok Mini API for generating paper summaries
- Summary includes:
  - Key findings
  - Methodology overview
  - Practical implications
  - Technical complexity level
- Summaries are cached locally to avoid repeated API calls

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- SwiftUI for iOS app development
- Local storage using CoreData
- Push notification handling

### Backend Services
- arXiv API for paper discovery
- Grok Mini API for paper summarization
- Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)

## MVP Limitations
- Limited to arXiv papers only
- Maximum 5 topics per user
- Summaries generated only on demand
- No user accounts or cross-device sync
- No paper bookmarking or reading history

## Success Metrics
- Number of active users
- Average number of papers viewed per user
- Number of summaries generated
- User retention rate
- Notification engagement rate

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- User accounts and cross-device sync
- Additional paper sources (e.g., IEEE, ACM)
- Paper bookmarking and reading history
- Social sharing features
- Custom topic creation
- Offline paper storage
- Reading time estimates
- Related papers recommendations

## Development Timeline
- Day 1: Project setup, UI design, and arXiv API integration
- Day 2: Topic selection and paper discovery implementation
- Day 3: Push notification system and Grok Mini API integration
- Day 4: Summary generation and caching system
- Day 5: Testing, bug fixes, and App Store preparation

## Technical Requirements
- iOS 15.0 or later
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- Swift 5.0
- Internet connection for paper fetching and summaries
- Push notification permissions
